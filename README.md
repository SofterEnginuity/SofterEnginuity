## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript

This project was built with a template that was chose to most effectively display my projects as well as provide multiple channels of communication. 

## Lessons Learned:

Modifying some of the nested elements was pretty challenging. While targeting speficic items, it felt like I was peeling an onion. It was pretty cool to see how in depth these sections can get!
