Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Angel!

Philly-based MERN developer originally from Iowa.(Long way, I know) I turn concepts into web solutions by blending my IT roots with hands-on development. Driven by a passion for making tech accessible and intuitive - I get excited about bridging current tech with the real world! Oh, and I basically run a mini zoo at homeâ€” so that always keeping things interesting!
